# PEWLETT-HACKARD ANALYSIS

Week7 SQL 

---
## Overview of Project

Utilizing employee records, write SQL Queries to determine the number of our aging workforce that would be retiring, as well determining those soon-to-retire employees eligible for the new Mentorship Program. 

---
### Purpose

In this Module we wrote our first SQL Queries, faced challenges with importing files, and grew as coders.

---
## Background

We were presented with employee records and asked to process a subset of that data in certain ways. We first identified those employees that would soon be eligible to retire (those born from 1955 to 1958), then determined their most recent title. Finally, we narrowed the search to those who were born in 1965 as a list of candidates who would make good mentors.

## Results
After examining  the data, it is shocking to realize the huge amounts of institutional knowledge Pewlett_Hackard will lose in the next few years, and it is perhaps indicative of the general attitude of the company that we are just noticing this now. We have, for far too long, relied on our legacy, and that legacy is walking out the door. It is sobering to think that we are just now identifying those who can train our next generation of leaders, and those who we are identifying have been here for more than thirty years. What have we been doing for those three decades that we have not been tapping into the combined millenia of knowledge walking out the door every week? We have ignored an entire generation of leaders, coasting on the "baby boom" generation for far too long. We have squandered an entire generation of minds, an invaluable resource, and rightly suffer for it.
